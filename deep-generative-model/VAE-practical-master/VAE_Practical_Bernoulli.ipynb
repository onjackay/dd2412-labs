The former was published slightly prior to the latter, and has recieved considerably more citations.

It consists of two parts, called encoder and decoder. With the help of encoder, we can map a given input sample $x_{ori} \\sim p(x)$ to a distribution over the latent space. The distribution is denoted by $q_{\\phi}(z|x_{ori})$ and $\\phi$ denotes the parameters of the encoder (optimized via training), called ([variational](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/tutorials/variational.html)) parameters. \n",

Variational approximation, (finding the best or closest function to a given function, in our case the true distribution over the latent sapce $p(z|x_{ori})$) is usually done because of the complexity of the original function (it means, it is hard to work with $p(z|x_{ori})$ because it has interactable terms)."

To this end, we need to find the closest $q_\\phi(z|x_{ori})$ to $p(z|x_{ori})$, and the parameters of $q_\\phi(z|x_{ori})$ (in our example, a good $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$) are called **variational parameters**. The subscript $\\phi$, also called variational paramters or encoder paramters, denotes that the distribution we get, depends on some other variables that has to be optimized (i.e. the variables that we use to map a given input $x$ to a distribution over the latent space, for example $\\phi=\\{W_1,W_2,b_1,b_2\\}$ if we are using a two layer MLP)."

Then, after getting the paramters of a distribution over the latent space $q_\\phi(z|x_{ori})$, it is time to reconstruct the input sample $x_{ori}$ from its latent representation $q_\\phi(z|x_{ori})$, but the problem is that we can not use a function as input into the decoder! So what we can do is to draw (several) samples from the latent distribution $q_\\phi(z|x_{ori})$ and recover a distribution over the  input space. Another the problem is that it is that, sampling is not differentiable, making our model indifferentiable.
