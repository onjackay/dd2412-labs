# VAE-practical
In this practical we learn about and implement advanced extensions of the VAE in JAX. Especially, we focus on extensions of the VAE obectives (relating to beta-vae and importance weighted auto-encoder) which are both commonly used when benchmarking VAEs, and take a look at an out-of-distribution-detection example. Other experiments include visualizing the latent space and generating synthetic data.
